'Historically, PD used bare "picture box" controls as control containers.  This was redundant and silly,
' as picture boxes require a lot of resources, and they expose a ton of features we don't need when we
' just want to group a bunch of controls into an easier-to-manage form.
'
'So this new control container was built.  It's fully themable, but it *doesn't* manage a true backbuffer, so you
' can't render strange custom stuff to it (by design).  It is also lighter-weight than a comparable picture box
' would be, while still reporting useful things like DPI-accurate size changes.
